## My process

1. Planning and Setup
   Objective: Create a responsive blog preview card that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
   Tools: HTML, CSS, and a code editor (e.g., VSCode).
   Design Reference: Used a design mockup to guide the layout and styling.
2. Structuring the HTML
   Basic Structure: Started with a basic HTML5 template.
   Content Layout: Added the necessary elements including the image, title, description, and author information.
   Semantic HTML: Ensured the use of semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.
3. Styling with CSS
   Global Styles: Applied a CSS reset and set global styles for consistency.
   Variables: Defined CSS variables for colors and fonts to maintain a consistent design.
   Card Styling: Styled the card container, image, text, and profile sections.
   Hover Effects: Added hover effects to interactive elements like the title.
4. Making it Responsive
   Media Queries: Used media queries to adjust the layout and styling for different screen sizes.
   Mobile Design: Ensured the card looks good on mobile devices by adjusting widths, margins, and font sizes.
   Testing: Tested the design on various screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
5. Final Touches
   Box-Shadow: Adjusted the box-shadow to match the design reference.
   Validation: Validated the HTML and CSS to ensure there are no errors.
   Optimization: Optimized the code for better performance and readability.
6. Deployment
   GitHub: Pushed the project to a GitHub repository for version control and sharing.
   Live Preview: Used GitHub Pages to host a live preview of the project.
